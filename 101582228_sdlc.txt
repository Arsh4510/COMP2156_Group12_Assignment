DevOps plays a critical role in the modern Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) by removing the
 traditional silos between development and operations teams. By integrating DevOps practices,
 engineers can automate testing, build, and deployment processes, resulting in faster release
 cycles and higher code quality. It shifts the focus from manual hand-offs to continuous 
collaboration, ensuring that software is not only developed quickly but also deployed reliably
 and securely. For a System Administrator, understanding DevOps is essential for maintaining 
scalable infrastructure and ensuring smooth application performance in production environments.

By integrating DevOps into the SDLC, teams can detect issues early,
improve collaboration, and deliver software updates more frequently.

DevOps helps reduce the gap between development and operations teams,
leading to faster deployment cycles.

Automation in DevOps ensures continuous testing, monitoring, and
improvement throughout the software lifecycle.
